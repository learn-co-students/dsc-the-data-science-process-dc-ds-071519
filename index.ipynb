Some of the questions that the data scientist might be asked to answer could include:\n",

    "* How much or how many? E.g. Identifying number of new customers likely to join your company in next quarter. (Regression analysis)\n",

Based on the nature of analystical question asked in the first step, a data scientist may have to engineer additional features not found in the original dataset. Feature engineering is the process of using expert knowledge to transform raw data into meaningful features that directly address the problem you are trying to solve. For example, taking weight and height to calculate Body Mass Index for the individuals in the dataset. This stage will substantially influence the accuracy of the predictive model you construct in the next stage. \n",

Predictive Modelling refers to the process of using probabalistic statistical methods to try to predict the outcome of an event. For example, based on employee data, an organisation can develop a predictive model to identify employee attrition rate in order to develop better retention strategies.\n",

    "Choosing the \"right\" model is often a challenging decision as there is never a single right answer. Selecting a model involves balancing the accuracy and the computational cost of the analysis process. For example, some recent approaches in predictive modelling such as deep learning have been shown to offer vastly improved accuracy of results, but with a very high computational cost.\n",
